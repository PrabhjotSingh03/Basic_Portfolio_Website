                        The Internet of Things, commonly abbreviated as IoT, refers to the connecting devices to the Internet. Cars, home appliances, and even medical devices can all be connected through the IoT. Any stand-alone internet-connected device that can be monitored and/or controlled from any location 
                        is considered an IoT device. With more smaller, more powerful chips, almost all products can be an <a href="https://www.datamation.com/mobile/85-top-iot-devices/"><em>Internet of Things devices.</em></a>The IoT is a giant network of connected things and people, all of which collect and share data about the 
                        way they are used and about the environment around them.The term IoT is mainly used for devices that wouldn't usually be generally expected to have an internet connection, and that can communicate with the network independently of human action. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>In a nutshell, IoT works in the following way:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Devices have hardware like sensors, for example, that collect data.</li>
                        <li>The data collected by the sensors is then shared via the cloud and integrated with software.</li> 
                        <li>The software then analyzes and transmits the data to users via an app or website.</li> 
                    </ul>  
                    <p>
                        For this reason, a PC isn't generally considered an IoT device and neither is a smartphone -- even though the latter is crammed with sensors. A <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/smartwatch">smartwatch</a> or a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/fitness-tracker">fitness band</a> or other wearable device might be counted as an IoT device, however. 
                        Smart devices connect to an IoT platform, described by the experts at <a href="https://www.iotforall.com/what-is-an-iot-platform">IoT For All</a> as "the support software that connects everything in an IoT system." There are hundreds of IoT platforms and some are made by such industry giants as 
                        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/iot-cloud/index.html#:~:text=Oracle%20Internet%20of%20Things%20(IoT,integrate%20your%20data%20with%20enterprise">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/internet-of-things#:~:text=The%20hub%20of%20the%20IBM,Your%20application%20and%20analytics" >IBM</a>. 
                        IoT platforms are designed to determine which data is of use and which can be discarded in order to detect patterns, make recommendations and find problems, often before they occur.

                        The Internet of Things is already helping to automate and simplify many daily tasks for business, industry, and in the domestic area. Lowering costs, increasing productivity and safety, enhancing customer experience, and generating new revenue streams, the IoT can help us make better decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regard to business, the IoT provide several important benefits including the ability to access and analyse data, removing the need to external data analysts or market researchers. The IoT is able to cope with big data analytics in real time, demonstrating how products and services are performing in the real world, and creating a situation where improvements can be made rapidly.
